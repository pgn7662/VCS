This is the edited text where I reset the changes using git reset commitId
The common commands are:
1. git init - initializing a repo
2. git add - staging a file to commit to the repo
3. git status - to check the status of the file as staged/ unstaged
4. git commit - commit changes to the repo
5. git log - view history of the changes done to a repo
6. git restore --staged filename/all - to unstage a file 
7. git reset commitId -  to revert the commit it will change all changes to a file
8. git stash - to save changes that can be commit later
9. git stash pop - to stage changes for commiting
10. git stash clear - to unsave/ clear changes
